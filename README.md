# Lab 1 - Create a website for someone who sells beats using HTML and CSS

## Objectives

- Create a web page for someone who sell beats
- The page can have whatever you like but here are some ideas to get you started
- A header with the producers stage name
- A picture or logo representing the producer
- A short bio about the producer
- A list of the beats that producer has for sale
- Use CSS to style the page and see if you can get it to look nice
- The producer you are using can be yourself or, if that's too personal, make one for one of your favorite producers
- Use git and github to commit and push your changes

## Resources

Here is an example of a beat seller's website https://hendrixbeats.com/
Don't worry about adding songs, a list of beat names will do fine for this exercise, we will revisit the "beat page" later as you learn more about coding.

If you get stuck the following places are reputable sources to learn more about HTML and CSS
- [Mozilla MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) This is the holy web developers bible of references for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) This is the most popular forum for developers who are stuck on trying to figure something out
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) A fairly reliable source for CSS information - use MDN first if you can
