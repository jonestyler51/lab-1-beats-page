# Lab 1 - Create a website for someone who sells beats using HTML and CSS

## Objectives

- Create a web page for someone who sell beats
- The page can have whatever you like but here are some ideas to get you started
- A header with the producers stage name
- A picture or logo representing the producer
- A short bio about the producer
- A list of the beats that producer has for sale
- Use CSS to style the page and see if you can get it to look nice
- The producer you are using can be yourself or, if that's too personal, make one for one of your favorite producers
- Use git and github to commit and push your changes

## Bonus Objectives
- Use table elements to create a table for the beats, with Name, Description, and Price being the three columns
- Use CSS media queries to make the website mobile friendly
- Properly implement semantic html to make the site accessible to screen readers
- Link a javascript file and put a buy now button in the header that triggers an alert that says "Purchased!"

## Instructions
### Cloning the repo
- copy the git-url from this repository at github.com
- go to the terminal and `cd` into `/projects`
- use the command `git clone {giturl}` to clone down the repository

### Install the Live Server vs-code extension
- In the extensions tab of vs-code, make sure you have live server installed. You can use it to host your website locally on your computer

### Make your webpage
- The repo has an initialized html and css file linked together
- Manipulate the existing files to satisfy the objectives

## Resources

Here is an example of a beat seller's website https://hendrixbeats.com/
Don't worry about adding songs, a list of beat names will do fine for this exercise, we will revisit the "beat page" later as you learn more about coding.

If you get stuck the following places are reputable sources to learn more about HTML and CSS

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) This is the most popular forum for developers who are stuck on trying to figure something out
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) A fairly reliable source for CSS information - use MDN first if you can
